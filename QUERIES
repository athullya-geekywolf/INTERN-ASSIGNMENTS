"Purpose of the IDENTITY keyword in the CREATE TABLE statement"
Purpose of IDENTITY keyword is to create an auto-incrementing number for a column automatically. Does not enforce uniqueness like primary key.

"How would you modify the table to ensure that the Salary column cannot contain negative values?"
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD CONSTRAINT check_salary
CHECK (Salary >= 0);

"How would you add a UNIQUE constraint to the Employees table to ensure that no two employees can have the same email address"
Cannot add a new column with unique email constraint. 
Instead add the email column, handle the null cases and then set the constraint.
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD EMAIL VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE Employee
SET Email = 'email@example.com' + CAST(EMPID AS VARCHAR) -- Assuming ID is unique
WHERE Email IS NULL;

ALTER TABLE Employee
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email UNIQUE (Email);

"Write an ALTER TABLE statement to add an "Email" column to the Employees table with a UNIQUE constraint that allows NULL values"
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE
ADD NEWEMAIL VARCHAR(20);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_mail ON Employee (NewEmail) WHERE NewEmail IS NOT NULL;
